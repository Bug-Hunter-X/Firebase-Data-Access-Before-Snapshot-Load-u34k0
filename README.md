This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before it's fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles asynchronous operations correctly using promises or async/await.  The issue occurs when asynchronous Firebase calls aren't awaited or handled with promises, leading to undefined values.
